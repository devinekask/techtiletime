description: How to make paper stickers with the Cricut.

## Materials

Cricut themselves are selling sticker paper, but you can use any sticker/label paper that fits your printer.
For this tutorial, we are using Avery multi-purpose labels. They are just labels the size of a regular A4 sheet of paper.

## Design

You will have to create your design somewhere. It doesn't really matter where. You can use vector or raster graphics.

## Raster image

Make sure you have a transparent background. You can use the magic wand tool in Photoshop to remove the background.
Add a border around your design. 3-5mm should be enough.

### Importing raster image

- Open the Cricut Design Space app
- Click on `New Project`
- Click on `Upload`
- Click on `Upload Image`
- Select the image you want to use
- There is a background removal tool in the app. Be carefull with this, it can remove parts of your design.
- Convert it to a 'Flat Graphic'

### Set raster image

- Select the element on the canvas
- In the toolbar, select `Print then Cut`

## Vector graphics

You also need a border around your design. [This approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awbzbJsvHxs) works fine.
Save it as an SVG file.

### Impoting vector graphics

- Open the Cricut Design Space app
- Click on `New Project`
- Click on `Upload`
- Click on `Upload Image`
- Select the image you want to use

### Set vector image

When the image is on the canvas, inspect the layers. You will see that the image is split into layers.

- Flatten all te layers into one layer
- In the toolbar, select `Print then Cut`

The Cricut will now cut around the border of your design, using the outmost path.

## Make

Click on the 'make' button in the top right corner.

- Under `Material Size`, select A4 as the size of your sticker paper.
- If you want more than one sticker, increase the number of project copies. When you click apply, you can see in the preview how the stickers are placed on the paper. Watch out that you only have one page.
- Click on `Continue`
- Click on `Send to printer`
  - Add the sticker paper in the printer and print
- Select the appropriate material and follow the instructions on the screen.
