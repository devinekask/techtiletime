With the [Cricut](https://cricut.com/en-gb/), you can cut paper, vinyl, fabric, and more. It's a smart cutting machine that can cut and draw on a wide range of materials.

## Getting started

- Install the [Cricut Design Space](https://design.cricut.com/) app on your computer
- During the installation:
  - you will be asked to create a subscription, don't do this. You can use the app without a subscription.
  - you will be asked to make a test cut, you can skip this step.
- We have a Cricut Maker 3
- You can connect the Cricut via USB or Bluetooth. We are using USB.

## General tips

- If you are importing vector images, all the shapes are considered as separate 'things to cut'. If you want to group them, (which you probably will...) select all the layers and click on 'Attach'.
