## Regular fonts

You might not have thought about it that way, but a character is a shape in fact. Since a plotter, cutter etc needs "lines" in the end. This can be problematic. (or not, depending on your needs) Luckily there is a solution.

## Hershey fonts

The [Hershey fonts](https://paulbourke.net/dataformats/hershey/) are a set of vector fonts developed circa 1967 by Dr. Allen Vincent Hershey at the Naval Weapons Laboratory, originally designed to be rendered using vectors on early cathode ray tube displays. They are all constructed out of simple lines, this makes them perfect for plotting.
