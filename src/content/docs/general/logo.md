Yes, we have a logo! You can download it in various formats below.

## About the logo

A team of professional designers created the TechTileTime logo, based on a couple of constraints so it would also be a perfect use case for our machines.

- A clean line drawing suitable for plotting, embroidery, and cutting.
- A single color.
- Optionally integrate a tile or grid motif.
- Remain recognizable when mirrored.

## Versions

We have a stroke version (plotter) and a outlined version (embroidery, vinyl cutting)
