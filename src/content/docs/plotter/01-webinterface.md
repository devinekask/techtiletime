The most easy way to get a vector file plotted is to use the web interface 'saxi'. You could install this on your own machine and connect the plotter via USB to your computer. But we've provided a Raspberry Pi which is connected to the plotter, has Saxi installed and has its own network.

## Steps

1. Connect to the `eduroam-2.4` wifi network
2. Open a browser and go to <http://harryplotter.technet.howest.be:9080/>
3. Drag your SVG file on te canvas
4. Adjust settings if needed
5. Align the paper, fix it in place with some magnets (check if they aren't in the path of the plotter)
6. Click the 'pen up' button, the penclip should be raised up then.
7. Mount the pen, make sure its point is hovering a couple of millimeters above the paper
8. Plot!
